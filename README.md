# Complexity_Data

The project is an effort to evaluate complexity of algorithms using gradient boosted trees. Complete discription of the work can be found in here ( https://github.com/saisumit/Complexity_Data/blob/master/Predicting%20the%20algorithmic%20time%20complexity%20of%20single%20parametric%20algorithms%20using%20multiclass%20classification%20with%20gradient%20boosted%20trees.pdf )
